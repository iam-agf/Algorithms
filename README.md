# Algorithms and Data Structures

  A list of algorithms and data structures I wrote in order to learn about them. If they need any explanation in the code implementation, it will be added.
  This list can be stuck when I don't have time to implement new ones, but anyone who wants to add any algorithm is welcome.
  All the implementations here will be in Python3.
  
## Actual added algorithms.
1. [Rabin-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm)
